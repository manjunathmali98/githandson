Remove a File from Github Repo
1. git rm <fileName>  --- removes the file from your local directory
2. git status --- to check if the file deletion is to be done on the Repo
3. git commit -m "removing the file <filename> from Repo"
          OR
if you manually deleted a file then git will detect that the file is deleted and "git add ." will not work so then, we need to use "git add -u" and then perform git commit

To ignore some files being commited to git 
create a .gitignore file and then add the filename or type to it , Ex: *.log will ignore all LOG files and save the .gitignore file
